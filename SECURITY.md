# Security Policy

**ScottPlot minimizes security risk** by making all source code available, using only official Microsoft-backed NuGet dependencies, carefully reviewing all code contributions, building and publishing packages in the cloud with GitHub Actions, and using deterministic builds and SourceLink for all packages deployed to NuGet.

**Supported Versions:** Security updates are applied to all major versions of ScottPlot present in this repository.

**Reporting a Vulnerability:** Users are encouraged to share security insights publicly by posting a GitHub issue so the discussion may benefit the open source community. Alternatively, issues may be reported privately to [Scott W Harden](https://swharden.com/about/) (ScottPlot's primary maintainer) by email swharden@gmail.com
